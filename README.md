## 🧠 About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer with expertise in **natural language processing**, **real-time AI applications**, and **backend architecture**. I bridge the gap between engineering and product thinking — shaping systems that are scalable, impactful, and elegantly simple.

> I believe in building **lean, ethically sound, and purposeful AI systems** — especially where lives, decisions, or trust are involved.
