## 🧠 About Me

I’m a machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in **natural language processing**, **healthcare AI**, and **full-stack product thinking**. My journey spans building intelligent systems, architecting backend infrastructure, and increasingly steering product decisions that align tech with real-world needs.

I believe in building **purpose-driven software** — systems that are lean, scalable, and human-centered.
